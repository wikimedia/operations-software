In Fundraising this is all configured by a puppet module that is pretty
specific to our platform. Certainly the install portion could be packaged, but
there's a lot of fiddly user configuration both locally and on target hosts
that is tedious without orchestration.

On the deployment server . . .

1) Install dependencies.

 apt-get install git rsync libfile-find-rule-perl yamllint php5-cli

2) Tweeze executables and library to deployment system.

 mkdir -p /usr/local/FrDeploy/bin
 cp bin/fundraising_code_update /usr/local/FrDeploy/bin/
 cp bin/rsync_blaster /usr/local/FrDeploy/bin/
 cp lib/FrDeploy.pm /usr/share/perl5
 cp bin/fundraising_code_update.wrapper /usr/local/bin/fundraising_code_update
 cp bin/rsync_blaster /usr/local/bin/rsync_blaster

3) Create group 'www-data' (typically present as stock Debian webserver group).

 groupadd www-data

4) Create user 'deploy' with initial login group 'www-data'.

 useradd -m -d /var/lib/deploy -g www-data -s /bin/bash deploy

5) Add sudoers policy for local groups or users to run these tools.

 # /etc/sudoers.d/FrDeploy
 %sysops ALL = (deploy) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/FrDeploy/bin/fundraising_code_update
 %sysops ALL = (deploy) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/FrDeploy/bin/rsync_blaster

6) Set up localsettings git repository.

7) Make sure /srv directory exists and is writable by the deploy user. You
don't have to use /srv, that's just what we do in Fundraising.

8) Create /etc/FrDeploy.conf, see FrDeploy.conf.EXAMPLE and tweak accordingly.

9) Generate ssh keypair for deploy user.


On each target host . . .

11) Create deployment user matching 'remote_user' in your FrDeploy.conf.  This
is a place where you could enhance security a bit by using rssh as the deploy
user's shell, and restricting ssh sessions to rsync.  But if you want to use
the service-restart rsync_blaster feature, you need full ssh access anyway.

 useradd -m -d /var/lib/deploy -g www-data -s /bin/bash deploy

12) Add the deploy user's public ssh key created in #9 to the local deploy
user's authorized_keys.

13) Make sure /srv directory exists and is writable by the local deploy user.
Again, you don't have to use /srv, that's just what we do in Fundraising.

14) If you're using service-restart, configure sudo permissions as necessary to
allow the local deploy user to run the command in question.

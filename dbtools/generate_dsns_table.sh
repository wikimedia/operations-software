# The dsns tables are used by pt-table-checksum as another method to
# discover slaves instead of "show processlist".

# We are using this method in order to tell pt-table-checksum which slaves
# it should look for, so we can discard dbstores and sanitarium hosts
# which might be delayed and then would stop the check forever.

# This quick and small shell script just parses the output from *.hosts
# files to identify the slaves, remove the dbstore or sanitarium ones, as
# well as the primary master and builds the syntax to run on mysql to
# populate the dsns tables.

# The dsns tables live under the dsns database on Tendril hosts.
# There is one table per shard at the moment.
